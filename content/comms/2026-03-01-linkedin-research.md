This week’s frontier AI signal (research view):

The strongest shift is not “bigger pretraining = better outcomes.”
It’s “better post-training systems = more durable capability.”

Three observations:
1. Post-training and agent orchestration quality are becoming primary differentiators.
2. Tacit-skill supervision looks like the dominant bottleneck for reasoning transfer.
3. Benchmark improvements often overstate production readiness for long-horizon tool-use.

Research implications:
- prioritize long-horizon evals with failure-recovery metrics,
- invest in targeted tacit supervision pipelines,
- track uncertainty and contradiction drift across time, not just static pass/fail scores.

If an agent’s performance collapses after a few tool calls, that is a systems/eval problem, not just a model-size problem.

Frontier signal this week (research lens):

1) The center of gravity is shifting from pretraining scale to post-training system quality.
2) Tacit-skill supervision is the bottleneck for robust reasoning transfer.
3) Benchmark gains without long-horizon tool reliability are fragile.

Practical priority:
- optimize eval loops for multi-step tool reliability,
- measure recovery after early errors,
- invest in targeted synthetic+human supervision.

If your agent fails after 3–4 tool calls, your benchmark curve is not your moat.

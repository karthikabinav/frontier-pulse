AI product takeaway this week:

Ship bounded-depth reliability before deep autonomy.

What works now:
- deterministic tool schemas
- strict retries/fallbacks
- recovery-first orchestration
- confidence-aware routing

Reliable 3-step workflows beat brittle 12-step demos.

Distribution + procurement fit + infra access are becoming as important as model quality itself.

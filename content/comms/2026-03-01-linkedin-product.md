Product strategy note for AI teams:

The near-term winners are not the teams with the deepest autonomy demos.
They’re the teams with the most reliable bounded workflows.

What actually ships:
- deterministic tool contracts,
- retries + fallback routing,
- explicit confidence/caveat handling,
- strong observability on multi-step failures.

Current market reality:
- buyers care about reliability and governance fit,
- procurement/policy alignment is now part of product execution,
- infra/distribution rights increasingly shape go-to-market outcomes.

Recommendation:
Optimize for trustworthy, high-uptime 3–5 step agent workflows first. Then expand autonomy depth once recovery and control planes are mature.

# Building Frontier Pulse in Public: Week 1 Kickoff

## 1) Why this week mattered
This week established the foundation for Frontier Pulse as a long-horizon automated AI researcher, not a one-off summarizer.

## 2) What we shipped
- Created a standalone project at `/Users/karthikabinav/kabinav/frontier-pulse`.
- Scaffolded backend (`FastAPI`) and frontend (`React + Vite`) with clear module boundaries.
- Defined core docs for collaboration and multi-agent handoff:
  - `PROJECT_TRACKER.md`
  - `PLANNING_QUESTIONS.md`
  - `DECISIONS.md`
- Added early domain models for:
  - versioned research briefs
  - long-term indexable research memory
- Added ingestion policy endpoint:
  - `GET /api/v1/workflows/ingestion-policy`

## 3) Architecture changes
- Policy defaults now support multi-source ingestion (arXiv, OpenReview, blogs, X, Reddit, university blogs).
- Scheduler default set to daily 2:00 AM Pacific (`America/Los_Angeles`).
- Deduplication policy set to fuzzy title+abstract matching.

## 4) Decisions made
- Treat revisions of older papers as first-class signal.
- Remove hard cap on batch size for focused topic tracking.
- Require auditable draft version history and long-term memory retention.

## 5) Validation and test status
- What we tested:
  - Filesystem scaffold and policy wiring verified.
- What is still untested:
  - Backend runtime startup
  - Frontend runtime startup
  - Docker DB boot
  - End-to-end weekly workflow

## 6) Failures, risks, and lessons
- The biggest risk remains decision churn: unresolved planning questions can cause rework.
- Multi-source ingestion increases complexity early; adapter boundaries are mandatory.

## 7) Metrics snapshot
- Ingested artifacts: N/A (pipeline not wired)
- Pipeline runtime: N/A
- Review-time impact: N/A

## 8) What is next
- Finalize parsing and chunking policies.
- Implement Phase 1 ingestion with DB migrations.
- Wire persistence APIs for briefs and memory entries.

## 9) Reader ask
If you’ve built multi-source research ingestion systems, I’d value your advice on robust dedupe and revision-tracking patterns.

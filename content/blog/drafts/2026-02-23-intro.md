# You’re Reading Too Much AI Research. Frontier Pulse Finds What Actually Matters.

AI is moving faster than anyone can keep up with.

Every week: new papers, new claims, new benchmarks, new hype.
Most people aren’t losing because they missed information.
They’re losing because they missed **signal**.

That is exactly why Frontier Pulse exists.

## The Core Idea

Frontier Pulse turns high-volume frontier AI updates into clear, decision-ready insight.

Instead of dumping more summaries, it focuses on three questions:

1. What is genuinely new?
2. What is likely to hold up?
3. Which trend is quietly becoming dominant?

## What Frontier Pulse Delivers

1. A weekly pulse of frontier research signal
2. Clear hypothesis-level insights, not just paper summaries
3. Structured outputs ready for X, LinkedIn, and long-form posts
4. A compounding research memory that gets sharper over time

## The Recursive Vision

This is a stepping stone to something bigger:
an agent recursively building a stronger AI researcher.

The loop is simple:

1. Build Frontier Pulse (V1)
2. Use it to generate better research memory and insight
3. Use that memory to build a better Frontier Pulse (V2)
4. Repeat

Over time, the system compounds.
Each version helps create the next version.

## Why This Matters Now

In AI, timing is strategy.
The people who spot real shifts earlier make better bets earlier.

Frontier Pulse is built for that edge.

## Built in Public

This project is being built in public from day one.
You’ll see weekly insights, product evolution, and real iteration as it matures.

## Follow the Launch

New Frontier Pulse X and LinkedIn accounts are going live.

If you care about where AI is actually heading, follow along.
If you care about signal over noise, this is for you.

This is Week 1.

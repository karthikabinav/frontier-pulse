# Frontier Pulse Was Built by an Agent

The future of research won’t be written by information overload.
It will be written by systems that find signal early.

**Frontier Pulse was built by an Agent** to do exactly that.

Frontier Pulse is an open AI researcher built to scan frontier AI conversations, detect what matters, and surface the ideas worth betting on.

## The Problem

Every week, frontier AI moves faster.
More papers. More posts. More claims. More noise.

Most people are not missing information.
They are missing clarity.

## The Promise of Frontier Pulse

Frontier Pulse helps you answer three critical questions, fast:

1. What is actually new?
2. What is likely to hold up?
3. What trend is becoming impossible to ignore?

It is built to turn scattered updates into clear direction.

## What You Get

With Frontier Pulse, you get:

1. A weekly pulse of frontier research signal
2. Clear hypothesis-level insights, not just summaries
3. Structured outputs you can publish immediately
4. A compounding research memory that improves over time

## Why This Matters

AI advantage is increasingly a **timing advantage**.
The teams that spot meaningful shifts earlier make better decisions earlier.

Frontier Pulse is designed to be that edge.

## Built in Public

This project is being built in public from day one.
You’ll see:

1. Weekly insights
2. Product iterations
3. What worked, what failed, and what changed

## Join the Frontier Pulse Launch

I’m launching new X and LinkedIn accounts for Frontier Pulse.

If you care about where AI is heading, follow along.
If you care about building with signal, this is for you.

This is Week 1.

## LinkedIn Post

**Frontier Pulse was built by an Agent.**

Frontier Pulse is an open AI researcher designed to help identify high-signal shifts in frontier AI early.

In a world with infinite updates, the advantage is no longer access to information.
The advantage is signal clarity.

Frontier Pulse turns frontier research flow into weekly insight and clear hypotheses you can act on.

I’m launching this in public with new X and LinkedIn accounts.

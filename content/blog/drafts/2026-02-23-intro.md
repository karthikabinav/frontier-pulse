# AI Research Is Broken. Frontier Pulse Fixes It.

AI is moving faster than anyone can keep up with.

Every week: new papers, new claims, new benchmarks, new hype.
Most people are not losing because they missed information.
They are losing because they missed **signal**.

That is why Frontier Pulse exists.

## The Core Idea

Frontier Pulse is an AI research system that turns high-volume frontier updates into clear, decision-ready direction.

It answers three questions every week:

1. What is genuinely new?
2. What is likely to hold up?
3. Which trend is becoming impossible to ignore?

## What Frontier Pulse Delivers

1. A weekly high-signal frontier pulse
2. Hypothesis-level insights (not just summaries)
3. Publish-ready outputs for X, LinkedIn, and long-form posts
4. A compounding research memory that gets sharper over time

## The Recursive Vision

This is step one in a recursive research loop:

1. Identify open research questions
2. Solve them
3. Publish findings
4. Learn from outcomes
5. Recurse

Each cycle makes Frontier Pulse a better AI researcher for the next cycle.

## Why This Matters

In AI, timing is strategy.
The teams that detect real shifts earlier make better bets earlier.

Frontier Pulse is built for that edge.

## Built in Public

Frontier Pulse is being built in public from day one.
You will see weekly outputs, product evolution, and iteration in real time.

## Follow the Launch

New Frontier Pulse X and LinkedIn accounts are going live.

If you care about where AI is actually heading, follow along.
If you care about signal over noise, this is for you.

This is Week 1.

# Introducing Frontier Pulse: Building an Open AI Researcher in Public

I’m launching **Frontier Pulse**.

The goal is simple to state and hard to build: create the first step toward an **open AI researcher** that can track frontier work continuously, extract real signal, and surface the hypotheses that actually matter over time.

Most “AI research tools” stop at summarization.
Frontier Pulse is built for something deeper: **structured alpha extraction + belief evolution**.

## Why I’m Building This

Every week, frontier AI research explodes across arXiv, OpenReview, labs, blogs, X, and Reddit.
The problem is no longer access to information.
The problem is **signal discipline**:

1. Which ideas are genuinely novel?
2. Which claims are fragile?
3. Which hypotheses keep getting stronger week after week?

If we want better decisions, we need systems that do more than summarize papers.
We need systems that preserve memory, track contradictions, and keep score over time.

## What Frontier Pulse Does (V1)

Frontier Pulse is a local-first research workflow that:

1. Ingests frontier sources (starting with arXiv + additional sources)
2. Extracts structured paper-level alpha cards
3. Builds a hypothesis graph with support/contradiction links
4. Clusters trends and bottlenecks
5. Produces a weekly brief for human review
6. Exports publication-ready outputs (X thread + LinkedIn + markdown)

Everything is designed for **human-in-the-loop judgment** with strong provenance and versioning.

## Design Principles

I’m optimizing for:

1. **Local-first inference** to keep recurring costs low
2. **Replaceable model layer** so model/provider choices can evolve
3. **Versioned memory** so belief changes are auditable
4. **Build-in-public transparency** so decisions and tradeoffs are visible

This is not a “vibes project.”
It is an infrastructure project.

## Why Build in Public

I’m creating new X and LinkedIn accounts for Frontier Pulse and documenting the full build process publicly.
That includes:

1. What works
2. What breaks
3. What I change and why

I want this to be useful to researchers, engineers, and builders trying to create serious AI research systems under practical constraints.

## What Comes Next

Near-term focus:

1. Better ingestion reliability across sources
2. Stronger extraction quality gates
3. Regression benchmark set for precision tracking
4. Cleaner weekly publishing workflow

Long-term ambition:
An **open, compounding AI researcher** that gets better at identifying high-leverage questions over time.

## Follow Along

I’ll publish:

1. Weekly Frontier Pulse research brief outputs
2. Build logs and architecture notes
3. Lessons from running this in production-like conditions

If you care about frontier AI, research tooling, and long-horizon hypothesis tracking, follow along.

This is Week 1.

## X Post (single)

I’m launching **Frontier Pulse**: a local-first system to track frontier AI research, extract structured alpha, and map belief evolution over time.

This is the first step toward an open AI researcher.

I’m building it in public, including what fails.

## X Thread (starter)

1/ I’m launching **Frontier Pulse**.

Goal: build the first step toward an open AI researcher.

Not a summarizer. A structured alpha + hypothesis evolution system.

[BLOG_LINK]

2/ Problem: frontier research volume is exploding.
Signal is not.

We need systems that track:
- novelty
- contradictions
- hypothesis strength over time

3/ Frontier Pulse V1 pipeline:
- ingest sources
- extract paper alpha cards
- build hypothesis graph
- cluster trends
- generate weekly brief
- publish to X/LinkedIn

4/ Principles:
- local-first inference
- versioned memory
- human-in-the-loop review
- build in public

5/ I’m documenting all of it: wins, failures, architecture decisions.

If you’re building serious research infra, I’d value your feedback.

## LinkedIn Post (founder voice)

Today I’m launching **Frontier Pulse**.

I’m building this because frontier AI research has a signal problem, not an access problem.

There’s more material than ever, but very little structure for tracking:
- which ideas are truly novel,
- which claims are fragile,
- and which hypotheses strengthen over time.

Frontier Pulse is my first step toward an **open AI researcher**:
- ingest multi-source research,
- extract structured alpha,
- build hypothesis graphs,
- and produce weekly human-reviewed briefs.

I’m building this in public and sharing both progress and failures.

If you care about research tooling, long-horizon hypothesis tracking, or practical AI infrastructure, I’d love your feedback.

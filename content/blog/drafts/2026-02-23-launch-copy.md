2/ The bottleneck isn’t access to information.
It’s signal clarity.

3/ Weekly output:
- what is genuinely new
- what is durable
- what trend is accelerating

4/ Frontier Pulse is built as a recursive system:
output -> evaluate -> improve -> rerun.

5/ Built in public from day one.
Follow the build.

## LinkedIn Post

AI research is exploding, but most people still miss signal.

That’s why I’m launching Frontier Pulse.

Frontier Pulse identifies high-signal shifts in frontier AI, turns them into actionable weekly hypotheses, and compounds over time through a recursive improvement loop.

If you care about AI strategy, research direction, and staying ahead of the curve, follow along.

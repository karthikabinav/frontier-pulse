# Frontier Pulse Weekly Strategy Memo

Date: 2026-03-01  
Audience: Internal (Research + Product + Investment)

## Executive Summary
Frontier AI differentiation is shifting from raw pretraining scale to post-training system quality: long-horizon tool reliability, memory/runtime orchestration, and eval rigor. Data quality (especially tacit-skill supervision) is now a first-order bottleneck. Commercial moat formation increasingly depends on deployment rights, infrastructure access, and procurement/policy fit.

## What changed this week
1. Post-training and agent-design signals strengthened (RL variants, scaffolded reasoning, runtime methods).
2. Evidence continued that scaling alone fails to close pragmatic/tacit reasoning gaps.
3. Practitioner signal remained clear: multi-step tool reliability still degrades quickly beyond shallow chains.
4. Lab communications suggest stronger GTM/infra positioning pressure vs core-model disclosure cadence.

## Implications by function
### Research
- Shift effort from generic benchmark gains to long-horizon robustness loops.
- Prioritize targeted tacit-skill supervision and recovery-oriented evals.
- Track failure progression across tool-call depth, not just final-task accuracy.

### Product
- Optimize bounded-depth, deterministic workflows before deeper autonomy.
- Productize failure-recovery orchestration (retry, fallback, uncertainty routing).
- Reliability and debuggability are higher ROI than additional agent depth right now.

### VC / Strategy
- Evaluate companies on post-training/eval compounding ability and deployment leverage.
- Procurement/policy alignment is becoming a direct execution moat variable.
- Separate "model quality" narratives from "system reliability at scale" evidence.

## Action priorities (next 7 days)
1. Add short-term memory/emerging-idea lane to Frontier Pulse outputs.
2. Strengthen long-term memory retrieval with query+recent-window controls.
3. Produce audience-specific messaging outputs (research, product, VC) every run.
4. Add confidence tags + caveat template to all outbound summaries.

## Risks
- Overfitting to headline cycles without durable cross-week synthesis.
- Overstating confidence when public-source visibility is partial (e.g., venue/API access gaps).
- Misalignment between audience messaging and evidence confidence tier.

## Decision
Proceed with product upgrades focused on:
- retrieval quality,
- short vs long memory separation,
- audience-specific narrative packaging,
- confidence-aware publishing discipline.
